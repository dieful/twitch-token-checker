## Requirements

pip install requests

pip install tkinter

pip install colorama

## Usage

1) Open Tokens File and Valid Tokens file
2) Script will automatically start checking tokens & writing them in valid.txt (or whatever ur file name is)
3) When the script is done checking all of the tokens, it will show you how many are invalid and valid

## Power

Takes about 20 seconds to check 1,000 tokens (50 per sec)

Speed can vary depending on your PC but overall its fast

## Additonal-Info

Script uses Tkinter to open txt files, that way its more easier and convient to load up the additional files needed.
